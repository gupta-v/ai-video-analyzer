## Software and Tools Requirements

1. [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
2. [Google AI Studio Account](https://aistudio.google.com/)
3. [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
4. [VSCode IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
5. [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line)
6. [Agno](https://docs.agno.com/)
7. [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Google AI Studio API key
- Agno API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-video-analyzer.git
   cd ai-video-analyzer
   ```

2. Create an Virtual Environment

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   - Activate the Virtual Environment
     ```sh
     venv/Scripts/Activate       # on windows
     source venv/bin/activate    # on mac
     ```

3. Install required packages:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Edit the `.env` file and add your API keys:

   ```sh
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"
   AGNO_API_KEY="your_agno_api_key_here"
   ```

   - You'll need to:
     - Get a Google API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
     - Get an Agno API key from [Agno](https://app.agno.com/)

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Upload a video file in the supported format (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV)

4. Wait for the video processing to complete

5. Start chatting with the AI about the video content:

   - Ask Questions:

     - Use the app to ask questions about the video content. The AI analyzes the video using Gemini 1.5 Flash and provides insightful answers.
     - e.g `What is the main theme of the video?`

   - Request Summaries & Analysis:

     - Get summaries, key points, or detailed breakdowns of the video content for better understanding.
     - e.g `Analyze the video and use key points to describe the detailed breakdown of the video content`

   - Search for Additional Information:

     - Use the integrated LangChain DuckDuckGoSearchRun tool to find related information or expand on the video's topic.
     - e.g `Summarize the video, use web search for the given information and authenticate it.`

   - Direct Web Search:
     - Alternatively, perform a direct web search for your query using the `Web Search üîç` feature, powered by LangChain's search tools.
     - e.g `What is Agno?` (Let's say the video was about Agno, so you can directly web search for it in the same application and get results.)

### Agent Interaction

The application uses:

- Agno's Agent framework with Gemini 1.5 Flash to process and understand video content
- LangChain's DuckDuckGoSearchRun tool for web search capabilities
- Streamlit for the interactive UI
- Session state for maintaining conversation context

## Data Description

The application handles various types of data:

- **Video Files**: Supports MP4, MOV, AVI, and MKV formats
- **Chat History**: Stored in session state for the duration of the session
- **Processed Video Data**: Temporarily stored during analysis
- **Web Search Results**: Retrieved via LangChain's DuckDuckGoSearchRun tool in real-time
- **Agent State**: Managed by Agno's framework

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Video Analysis**:

   - Scene detection and segmentation
   - Object and person recognition
   - Sentiment analysis of video content

2. **Enhanced User Experience**:

   - Custom video player controls
   - Timestamp-based questioning
   - Export functionality for chat history

3. **Performance Optimizations**:

   - Video compression before processing
   - Caching of frequent queries
   - Batch processing capabilities

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Multiple video comparison
   - Collaborative analysis sessions
   - Integration with additional LangChain tools (e.g., document loaders, memory modules)
   - Custom model fine-tuning options
   - Advanced LangChain-powered retrieval and search capabilities
