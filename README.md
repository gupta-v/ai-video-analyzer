## Project Overview

The **AI Video Summarizer & Chat Agent** is a powerful web application that combines video analysis capabilities with natural language processing and web search functionality. It uses Phidata's Agent framework to integrate Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model for video understanding and DuckDuckGo for supplementary web searches, providing users with comprehensive insights and information about their uploaded videos.

## Features

- **AI Agent Architecture**: Built using Phidata's Agent framework for seamless AI integration
- **Video Upload & Processing**: Support for multiple video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV)
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Video content analysis using Gemini 1.5 Flash
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Real-time conversation with the AI about video content
- **Web Search Integration**: Supplementary information from DuckDuckGo search
- **Session Management**: Automatic timeout after 1 hour of inactivity
- **Responsive UI**: Clean and intuitive user interface with auto-scrolling chat
- **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Combines video understanding with text-based responses
- **Temporary File Handling**: Secure processing of uploaded videos

## Uses and Scope

The AI Video Summarizer & Chat Agent serves multiple purposes across different domains:

- **Content Analysis**: Quickly understand and extract insights from video content
- **Research & Education**: Analyze educational videos and gather supplementary information
- **Content Creation**: Help content creators understand and improve their videos
- **Information Synthesis**: Combine video analysis with web search results for comprehensive understanding
- **Interactive Learning**: Engage with video content through natural language conversations
- **Agent-Based Processing**: Utilize Phidata's Agent framework for complex task handling

## Software and Tools Requirements

1. [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
2. [Google AI Studio Account](https://aistudio.google.com/)
3. [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
4. [VSCode IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
5. [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line)
6. [Phidata](https://docs.phidata.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Google AI Studio API key
- Phidata API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gupta-v/ai-video-analyzer.git
   cd ai-video-analyzer
   ```

2. Install required packages:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

Edit the `.env` file and add your API keys:

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"
    PHI_API_KEY="your_phidata_api_key_here"
    ```

You'll need to:

- Get a Google API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
- Get a Phidata API key from [Phidata](https://docs.phidata.com/)

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Upload a video file in the supported format (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV)

4. Wait for the video processing to complete

5. Start chatting with the AI about the video content:

   - Ask Questions:

     - Use the app to ask questions about the video content. The AI analyzes the video using PhiData and provides insightful answers, powered by Gemini 1.5.

     - e.g `What is the Main theme of the video?`

   - Request Summaries & Analysis:

     - Get summaries, key points, or detailed breakdowns of the video content for better understanding.

     - e.g `Analyze the video and use key points to describe the detailed breakdown of the video content`

   - Search for Additional Information:

     - Use the integrated DuckDuckGo web search through PhiData to find related information or expand on the video's topic.

     - e.g `Summarize the video,use web search for the given information and authenticate it.`

   - Direct Web Search:

     - Alternatively, perform a direct web search for your query using the `Web Search üîç` feature.

     - e.g `What is Phidata?` (Let's say the video was about phidata, so u can directly web search for it in the same application and get results and links to the website.)

### Agent Interaction

The application uses Phidata's Agent framework to:

- Process and understand video content
- Generate contextual responses
- Perform web searches when needed
- Maintain conversation coherence
- Handle multi-modal inputs (video and text)

## Data Description

The application handles various types of data:

- **Video Files**: Supports MP4, MOV, AVI, and MKV formats
- **Chat History**: Stored in session state for the duration of the session
- **Processed Video Data**: Temporarily stored during analysis
- **Web Search Results**: Retrieved from DuckDuckGo in real-time
- **Agent State**: Managed by Phidata's framework

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Video Analysis**:

   - Scene detection and segmentation
   - Object and person recognition
   - Sentiment analysis of video content

2. **Enhanced User Experience**:

   - Custom video player controls
   - Timestamp-based questioning
   - Export functionality for chat history

3. **Performance Optimizations**:

   - Video compression before processing
   - Caching of frequent queries
   - Batch processing capabilities

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Multiple video comparison
   - Collaborative analysis sessions
   - Integration with more search engines
   - Custom model fine-tuning options
   - Advanced agent capabilities using Phidata
